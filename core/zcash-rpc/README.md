This package does not yet work. It is just a skeleton with an idea of how
to implement the methods here:

https://zcash-rpc.github.io/

Once we get the client configured correctly. It should actually be a breeze
to implement the methods.

For now I'm mostly playing with `core/node-zcash-rpc` which is a fork of:

https://github.com/ruimarinho/bitcoin-core

HELP WANTED!
